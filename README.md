A game of battleship over internet. Has a built in chat function as well.

Uses tkinter as a gui. Host provides ip to local machine and client connects. Basic game of battleship.
Makes use of objects and other objects interacting with those objects.

There's probably some more stuff I'm forgetting. But in essense, it's an internet game of battleship with expected associated features.
